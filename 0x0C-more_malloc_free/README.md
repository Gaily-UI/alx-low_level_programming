The "malloc" and "free" functions are essential components of memory management in programming languages like C and C++. "malloc" stands for "memory allocation," and it is used to dynamically allocate a block of memory of a specified size. This memory can then be used to store data structures, arrays, and other variables. Once the allocated memory is no longer needed, the "free" function is used to release that memory back to the system, making it available for other uses.
