argc: Stands for "argument count." It is an integer that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself. The value of argc is at least 1.

argv: Stands for "argument vector." It is an array of strings (char*) that holds the actual command-line arguments passed to the program. The first element (argv[0]) is the name of the program itself, and the following elements (argv[1], argv[2], etc.) contain any additional arguments.
